1. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to communicate with databases. It allows you to store, fetch, update, and delete data. SQL is used to manage relational databases efficiently.

2. What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of data stored in tables. It allows easy storage, retrieval, and management of large amounts of structured information.

3. What is a table?

A table is a collection of rows and columns in a database that stores data about a particular entity, like employees or products. Each row is a record, and each column is a field.

4. What is a row?

A row is a single record in a table, representing one entity’s data. For example, one employee’s information is one row in the employee table.

5. What is a column?

A column is a field in a table that stores one type of information for all rows, like name, salary, or department.

6. What is a primary key?

A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot have duplicate or NULL values and ensures each record is unique.

7. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between tables, ensuring data consistency.

8. What is NULL?

NULL represents missing or unknown data. It is different from zero or empty string and is used when the value is undefined.

9. NULL vs 0

NULL means no value exists, while 0 is a numeric value. NULL indicates absence of data, whereas 0 is a valid number.

10. What is a constraint?

A constraint is a rule applied to a table column to enforce data integrity, such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, or NOT NULL.

11. What is SELECT?

SELECT is used to fetch data from a table. It allows you to choose specific columns, filter rows, sort data, and combine data from multiple tables.

12. What is WHERE?

WHERE is used to filter rows based on a condition. Only rows that satisfy the condition are returned in the result set.

13. WHERE vs HAVING

WHERE filters rows before aggregation, while HAVING filters grouped data after aggregation using GROUP BY.

14. What is DISTINCT?

DISTINCT removes duplicate rows from the result set, giving only unique values for the selected columns.

15. What is LIKE?

LIKE is used for pattern matching in SQL. It allows searching for partial matches using wildcards like % (any characters) and _ (single character).

16. What are wildcards?

Wildcards are symbols used in pattern matching. % matches zero or more characters, and _ matches exactly one character.

17. What is BETWEEN?

BETWEEN filters rows within a specific range, including the boundary values. For example, salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000.

18. What is IN?

IN checks whether a column’s value matches any value in a list. It is a concise alternative to multiple OR conditions.

19. What is ORDER BY?

ORDER BY sorts the result set by one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

20. What is LIMIT?

LIMIT restricts the number of rows returned by a query. It is useful for showing only top N records.

21. COUNT()

COUNT() returns the number of rows that match a condition. COUNT(*) counts all rows, while COUNT(column) counts only non-NULL values.

22. SUM()

SUM() adds up numeric values in a column. For example, total salary in a department can be calculated using SUM(salary).

23. AVG()

AVG() calculates the average of numeric values in a column. It is useful for finding mean salary, price, etc.

24. MIN() / MAX()

MIN() returns the smallest value and MAX() returns the largest value in a column.

25. GROUP BY

GROUP BY groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, allowing aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG to be applied per group.

26. HAVING

HAVING filters groups after aggregation. It is used with GROUP BY to select only those groups meeting a condition.

27. INNER JOIN

INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. It is used to combine related data.

28. LEFT JOIN

LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match exists, NULL is returned for right table columns.

29. RIGHT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match exists, NULL is returned for left table columns.

30. FULL JOIN

FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables. Non-matching rows have NULLs in the missing columns.

31. SELF JOIN

A self join is when a table is joined with itself. It is useful for hierarchical data, like employee-manager relationships.

32. When to use SELF JOIN

Use self join to compare rows in the same table, e.g., to find each employee and their manager from the employee table.

33. What is a subquery?

A subquery is a query inside another query. It is used to compute values or filter results dynamically.

34. Subquery vs JOIN

Subquery is a nested query returning values; JOIN combines data from two or more tables.

35. Correlated subquery

A correlated subquery depends on the outer query, running once for each row of the outer query.

36. INSERT

INSERT adds new rows to a table. For example, INSERT INTO employee(name, department) VALUES('Sumit','HR');

37. UPDATE

UPDATE modifies existing data in a table. For example, UPDATE employee SET department='Sales' WHERE id=2;

38. DELETE

DELETE removes rows from a table based on a condition. For example, DELETE FROM employee WHERE id=5;

39. DELETE vs TRUNCATE

DELETE removes rows one by one and can be rolled back; TRUNCATE removes all rows fast and cannot be rolled back.

40. TRUNCATE vs DROP

TRUNCATE deletes all data but keeps the table; DROP deletes the table and its structure permanently.

41. What is a view?

A view is a virtual table created by saving a SELECT query in the database. It behaves like a table, so you can query it directly. Views are often used to simplify complex queries or hide sensitive columns.

42. Why use a view?

Views are used to simplify complex queries, provide a layer of security by hiding certain columns, and make querying easier for repeated use.

43. Can we update a view?

Most views are read-only, but simple views on a single table can be updated. Complex views with joins or aggregations usually cannot be updated.

44. View vs Table

A table stores real data; a view stores only a query definition. Tables occupy storage, while views do not store data themselves.

45. View vs Temporary Table

A view is permanent and stores a saved query; a temporary table stores data temporarily and is deleted after the session ends.

46. What is an index?

An index is a database object that speeds up data retrieval. It is like a book index, helping you find rows faster.

47. Why use an index?

Indexes improve SELECT query performance, especially on large tables, by reducing the number of rows the database needs to scan.

48. Disadvantages of index

Indexes consume extra storage and can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations because the index must also be updated.

49. On which columns should we create index?

Create indexes on columns that are frequently searched, used in JOIN conditions, or used in ORDER BY and WHERE clauses.

50. How to handle NULL values?

Use functions like COALESCE or IFNULL to replace NULL with a default value. Also, handle NULLs carefully in conditions to avoid errors.

51. What is COALESCE()?

COALESCE() returns the first non-NULL value in its argument list. It is used to replace NULL with meaningful default values.

52. What is IFNULL()?

IFNULL() replaces NULL with a specified value. For example, IFNULL(salary,0) will return 0 if salary is NULL.

53. IS NULL vs = NULL

To check for NULL values, always use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. Using = with NULL does not work.

54. Find second highest salary

Use a subquery:
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);
This returns the second highest salary from the employee table.

55. Find duplicate records

Use GROUP BY and HAVING:
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*)>1;
This identifies duplicate rows based on the name column.

56. Find employees without manager

Use NULL check:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
This returns employees at the top of the hierarchy.

57. Department-wise count

SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY department;
This counts how many employees are in each department.

58. Max salary per department

SELECT department, MAX(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY department;
This finds the highest salary in each department.

59. Employee–manager self join

SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager FROM employee e JOIN employee m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
This retrieves each employee with their manager.

60. Delete duplicate records

DELETE e1 FROM employee e1 JOIN employee e2 ON e1.name=e2.name AND e1.id>e2.id;
This deletes duplicates while keeping one row.

61. Top N records

SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;
This returns the top 5 highest-paid employees.

62. Records present in one table but not in another

SELECT * FROM table1 t1 LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id=t2.id WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
This finds rows in table1 that do not exist in table2.

63. Total salary per department

SELECT department, SUM(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY department;
This sums salaries for each department.

64. Employees earning more than average

SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);
This selects employees with above-average salary.

65. Departments with more than 5 employees

SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*)>5;
This identifies large departments.

66. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing data into related tables.

67. What is denormalization?

Denormalization combines tables to improve query performance, even if it introduces some redundancy.

68. 1NF, 2NF, 3NF

1NF → No repeating groups, atomic columns
2NF → 1NF + every non-key column depends on the whole primary key
3NF → 2NF + no transitive dependency

69. What is ACID?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability, which are properties to ensure reliable database transactions.

70. What is a transaction?

A transaction is a group of SQL operations executed as a single unit. Either all succeed or all fail.

71. COMMIT vs ROLLBACK

COMMIT saves the changes made by a transaction, while ROLLBACK undoes them.

72. COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column)

COUNT(*) counts all rows including NULLs; COUNT(column) counts only non-NULL values in that column.

73. WHERE vs ON

WHERE filters rows after join; ON specifies join conditions to match rows between tables.

74. UNION vs UNION ALL

UNION removes duplicates; UNION ALL keeps duplicates when combining result sets.

75. EXISTS vs IN

EXISTS checks if a subquery returns any row and is usually faster for large datasets. IN checks if a value matches a set of values returned by a subquery.

76. CHAR vs VARCHAR

CHAR stores fixed-length strings and pads with spaces; VARCHAR stores variable-length strings without padding.

77. DELETE without WHERE

DELETE without WHERE removes all rows from the table.

78. Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP

DELETE → removes rows (can rollback)
TRUNCATE → removes all rows (cannot rollback)
DROP → deletes table completely

79. What is a stored procedure?

A stored procedure is a saved SQL program in the database that can be executed repeatedly with parameters.

80. What is a trigger?

A trigger is a SQL code that automatically runs when certain events occur, like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

81. What is a temporary table?

A temporary table stores data temporarily during a session and is automatically deleted after the session ends.

82. What is a materialized view?

A materialized view stores the results of a query physically and can be refreshed periodically. It improves performance for complex queries.
